# My dotfiles

This repo is an attempt to have a configuration that is
- portable between multiple macs
- consistent
- recoverable
- easy to maintain
- customizable

## Homebrew
This relies heavily on Homebrew as the main Mac Os package manager
```sh
brew bundle dump
```
Is the command I used to generate a  `Brewfile`

```sh
brew bundle --file Brewfile
```
is used to install many apps and cli tools at once
