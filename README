# My dotfiles

This repo is an attempt to have a configuration that is
- portable between multiple macs
- consistent
- recoverable
- easy to maintain
- customizable

The dotfiles are store in a git repository and kept in sync with the local configuration thanks to symbolic links.
The symbolic links are managed with stow

## GNU Stow
Here is a video that covers the basics of using GNU stow way better than I could do so go there to learn more about this fantastic tool -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs&t=10s

## Homebrew
This config relies heavily on Homebrew as the main Mac Os package manager to install binaries AND apps with a UI.

```sh
brew bundle dump
```
Is the command I used to generate a  `Brewfile`

```sh
brew bundle --file Brewfile
```
is used to install many apps and cli tools at once
